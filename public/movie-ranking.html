<h1>The best movies according to Shraddha</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all the time:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Brahmastra Part one : Shiva</h3>
<p>This movie is definitely the best one I have seen so far from Bollywood in terms of VFX . You will get to know about different Astras and about the most powerful one among them , Brahmastra , an Astra that can destroy the whole Universe . It's an amazing movie based on fight between pure and evil energies . A worth watching movie , I believe . </p>
<h3>Conjuring -1</h3>
<p>Well , I am into horror movies so no doubt this movie is in my top 3 list . It is based on a real life incident in which Ed and Lorraine Warren helps a family terrorised by variuos paranormal activites happening in their house . It's a thrilling movie and people who are into horror stuffs will enjoy it to the core.</p>
<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>I mean this movie is wow ! It inspires everyone to choose the path that they want to , do whatever they feel like and to enjoy life that too to the fullest . It's a masterpiece that shows the dark side of students' lives , the struggles that they have to go through in order to make their parents happy and proud and to get success early in life . It teaches everyone that life is not a race and everyone has their own pace . The only thing to remember is not to give up in any phase of life . I recommend everyone to watch this movie as it teaches us to focus on the things that matter to us rather than being in a race with everyone else. </p>
